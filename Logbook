I have coded a Python file that allows for a deck of cards to be built, a number of players to be
instantiated with names and stacks, and for each player to be dealt a hand from the deck.
Inspiration from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8YkjDH86Y4&t=136s

The next step is finding a way to lay down a flop, turn and river while saving the information
of the current hands and stacks. I will need to revisit my python book to help me with this.
I will worry about betting on hands later on, and developing an AI is much further down the line.

I might also try to get Griffin involved to help create a UI.

I have managed to code a class for the board and member functions to lay down a flop, turn and river.
I did this using input statements. I now need to create a pot and create player actions.

I have coded player actions for: fold, bet and call. Technically I can use these actions for check
and raise as well by concurrently betting 0 and an amount that is greater than the current bet.
I have an idea for using logic statements to enforce rules for when a bet is not met with another raise.
Also need to add an action for paying blinds.

I have now also made code for a pot class, including the ability to collect player bets and
to empty the pot. Currently have no way of identifying a winner so will put a pin in transferring
the money in the pot to the winner of the round.

I have just made an official project directory and online repository, including main and this logbook.
This line is testing that the github repo is working.

Temporarily working on Dad's old desktop while my laptop is getting fixed.

I have just made an action method that requests a player do one of:
check, fold, bet, raise or call. I also coded some logic to ensure that the move is legal, and if not then the action is retaken.

A class method to ask for actions from all the players has been added to assist in running of the methods. This will have to be editted once the dealer button is made and the order of play changes.
